<p>When I pulled the over 5,000 datasets from 22 federal agencies after the implementation of the implementation of <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/policy-memo">OMB Memorandum M-13-13</a> Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset, I was reminded how much work there is still do around opening up government data.</p>
<p>The federal government needs our help. This is a project that runs on Github, and is meant to allow you to adopt one of the federal government datasets that have been released and help organize, cleanup, convert to other formats, ad other things that are needed to make this government open data ready for integration.</p>
<p>I will be adopting one or more datasets a week, as I have time, trying to improve on the hard work the federal government has done. I encourage you to do the smae.</p>
<p>All you need to adopt a dataset is a Github account and some time. When browsing each agencies datasets, pulled from their data.json files, you will see an "adopt" button. When pressed it will authenticate using oAuth with your Github, create a new repository where each dataset adopted will be stored.</p>
<p>Each dataset will be established as a new branch within your repository. The entry from the agencies data.json file will be there, allowing you to clean up, generate new distributions in formats like CSV and JSON. Your adoption repository, branches, and their data.json entries will then be tracked by this site and included in each agencies data listings.</p>
<p>When you browse the datasets here it will show the dataset as pulled from each federal agencies data.json, but will also show each adopted users work. It is up to each agency or other data consumers to choose which dataset provides the most value to their goals.</p>
<p>My mission with Federal Agency Dataset Adoption is to motivate federal agencies to put out more datasets, in hopes of getting assistance in cleaning up and iterating upon them, as well as show them what is needed by the community when it comes to machine readable open datasets.</p>
