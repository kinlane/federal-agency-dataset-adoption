Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS Enterprise Data Warehouse. Forests and\/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features.The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Using the FCODE attribute, streams\/rivers\/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent\/ephemeral types. Linear features (streams & rivers) FCODES 46003 and 46006 and polygonal features (lakes and other waterbody) FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43612, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittentt\/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. Underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are exlcuded. Initially, all intermittent\/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest\/Region units. Subsequently, Forest\/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. The resulting avoidance areas may have overlapping features due to the buffering processes.The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000\/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.","download_url":"","accessURL":null},{"agency_id":"usda","identifier":"a13fdd96-630c-4251-851d-ced9ab0047b3","title":"U.S. Forest Service Aerial Fire Retardant Avoidance Areas","description":"A map service depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas delivered as part of the 2011 Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land Environmental Impact Statement.

Data includes location of terrestrial and hydrographic areas where the application of aerial fire retardant is to be avoided. Current aerial fire retardant standards prohibit application within 300 feet of hydrographic features. Therefore, this data may contain duplicate hydrographic areas already covered by existing standards.

This tabular dataset is meant to be joined with the NRCS Watershed Boundary Dataset HUC-12. The results of this assessment provides information that can identify areas of interest for protecting surface drinking water quality. The spatial dataset can be incorporated into broad-scale planning, such as the State Forest Action Plans, and can be incorporated into existing decision support tools that currently lack spatial data on important areas for surface drinking water. This project also sets the groundwork for identifying watersheds where a payment for watershed services (PWS) scheme may be an option for financing forest conservation and management on private unprotected forest lands.

Enter a state to see a station count.\r\n\r\n## Data Collection Methods ##\r\n\r\nThe data in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) obtains information about new stations from trade media, Clean Cities coordinators, an Add a Station form on the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) website, and through collaborating with infrastructure equipment and fuel providers.\r\n\r\nNREL regularly compares its station data with those of other relevant trade organizations and websites. Differences in methodologies and inclusion criteria may result in slight differences between NREL's database and those maintained by other organizations. NREL also collaborates with alternative fuel industry groups to maintain the data. NREL and its data collection subcontractor are currently collaborating with natural gas, electric drive, biodiesel, ethanol, and propane industry groups to establish best practices for identifying new stations in the most-timely manner possible and to develop a more rigorous network for the future.\r\n\r\n## Station Update Schedule ##\r\n\r\nExisting stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified. Based on an established data collection schedule, the database is updated once a month with the exception of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) data, which are updated twice a month. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database on a monthly basis or as they are identified.\r\n\r\n## Mapping and Counting Methods ##\r\n\r\nEach point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. A station appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of fuel dispensers or charging outlets at that location. Station addresses are geocoded and mapped using an automatic geocoding application. The geocoding application returns the most accurate location based on the provided address. Station locations may also be provided by external sources (e.g., station operators) and\/or verified in a geographic information system (GIS) tool like Google Earth, Google Maps, or Google StreetView. This information is considered highly accurate, and these coordinates override any information generated using the geocoding application.\r\n\r\n## Notes about Specific Station Types ##\r\n### Private Stations ###\r\nStations with an Access of \"Private - Fleet customers only\" may allow other entities to fuel through a business-to-business arrangement. For more information, fleet customers should refer to the information listed in the details section for that station to contact the station directly.\r\n\r\n### Biodiesel Stations ###\r\nThe Alternative Fueling Station Locator only includes stations offering biodiesel blends of 20% (B20) and above.\r\n\r\n### Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) ###\r\nAn electric charging station, or EVSE, appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of charging outlets at that location. The number and type of charging outlets available are displayed as additional details when the station location is selected. Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. To see a total count of EVSE for all outlets available, go to the Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State table. Residential EVSE locations are not included in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator.\r\n\r\n## Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations ###\r\nBecause many propane stations serve customers other than drivers and fleets, NREL collaborated with the industry to effectively represent the differences.

Detailed travel behavior information was obtained from more than 42,500 households via multiple data-collection methods, including computer-assisted telephone interviewing, online and mail surveys, wearable and in-vehicle GPS, and on-board diagnostic (OBD) sensors that gathered data directly from a vehicle's engine. Details of personal travel behavior were gathered within the region of residence, inter-regionally within the state, and in adjoining states and Mexico. The survey sampling plan was designed to ensure an accurate representation of the entire population of the state.\r\n\r\nThe CHTS included additional features\u2014more detailed data on vehicle-acquisition decisions, parking choices, work schedules and flexibility, use of toll lanes\/priced facilities, and walk and bicycle trips\u2014to support advanced model development.\r\n\r\n## GPS Data Logger\/On-Board Diagnostic Sensor ##\r\n\r\nThe GPS device used in the vehicle-based portion of the study and to support OBD data collection was the QStarz BT-Q1000x travel recorder, which recorded data at 1-second intervals. Additionally, a CarChip Fleet Pro OBD sensor was used in coordination with the in-vehicle GPS to collect vehicle speed, air-flow rate, throttle position, engine load, and engine speed in 5-second intervals. For the wearable portion of the study, the GlobalSat GPS data logger was used. This device was programmed to collect data at 3-second intervals and to record all GPS points where the speed was greater than one mph.","download_url":"","accessURL":null},{"agency_id":"energy","identifier":"DOE-4824","title":"Coal Production by MSHA ID, Mine Operation, and Union Status, 1991","description":"Coal Production Data Files contain information which identify the mining operation (i.e., operation name, mailing address, telephone number, State and county of operation, etc.), annual coal production, and code definitions.

Data for the project are voluntarily contributed from a variety of sources including utilities, installers, and the general public. The data collected is actively maintained by the contributors and are always changing to provide an evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the US solar power market.\r\n\r\n![Image of solar deployments on a map](https:\/\/openpv.nrel.gov\/assets\/img\/viz_slideshow\/timeMapper_panel.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Data Collection #\r\n\r\nThe Open PV Project is collecting data from any willing contributor of available information. NREL has \"seeded\" the Open PV database by requesting data from most state run incentive programs, large utilities, and other organizations. This initial data collection has provided a solid base of data for the project to launch from and it is our hope that the database will continue to grow through contributions from the PV community and anyone interested in understanding PV market dynamics in the US.\r\n\r\n## Data Quality ##\r\n\r\nDetermining the quality of incoming data is dependent upon who is submitting the data to the project. This means that data coming from users associated with a particular organization may be \"trusted\" more than data from other unknown users. Each registered user is assigned a default \"score\" based on their organizational affiliation. This score is highest for Government users (State, Federal, etc.) because such users are often involved with incentive programs that have a defined data collection process in place. Second are utility and PV installers (and others in the PV industry), and so on. All users who contribute data to the project have the ability to gain a \"project reputation\" that can impact the score of the data they contribute.\r\n\r\n## Validation ##\r\n\r\nData validation occurs on each record in the database on a regular basis. The database is continually analyzed for corrupt records, bad or invalid data, and outliers such as an abnormal cost to watt ratio. Records found to contain questionable data are flagged and are dealt with on a case by case basis by a member of the Open PV Team.\r\n\r\n## Duplication ##\r\n\r\nUnderstanding duplication is one of the ways that individual records are validated. In a publicly contributed database, it is imperative to anticipate the submission of duplicate records. When duplicate records are detected, they are added to an install specific list of duplicates and the data provided are aggregated into \"summary records\" of their respective installs. Identifying duplicate records helps validate PV installs in the database. The more a PV installation is duplicated in the database, the more trust the project places on the data for that installation.\r\n\r\n# Data Fields #\r\n## Required Fields ##\r\n\r\nThe Open PV Project is designed to be able to store nearly any type of information pertaining to PV installations. In order to provide the primary statistics from the database we have identified 4 data fields that are required of each PV install added to the project. These four fields are:\r\n\r\n-  Date Installed (Completion date or interconnection date)\r\n-  Size\/Capacity of the PV Installation (in kW DC)\r\n-  Location (Zipcode or Street Address)\r\n-  Total Installed Cost (in USD, before incentives)\r\n\r\n## Additional Fields ##\r\n\r\nThe four required fields listed above provide the Open PV Project with the base information needed to derive several key statistics on the US PV market, including historical trends and regional comparisons. However, the design of the Open PV database is capable of storing nearly any type of data associated with PV installation, so the Open PV Team would like to encourage you to contribute any additional information you are comfortable sharing. This extra information can be extremely valuable, for example, data that contains information about who installed the PV installation can help to answer very useful questions about where certain installers are working. Information on module or inverter types can be useful in mapping efficiency and detailed financing information can be a key factor in understanding trends in overall installation cost. The Open PV Team strongly encourages you to contribute any data you feel comfortable providing, especially data you would like to see visualized in our gallery someday.","download_url":"","accessURL":null},{"agency_id":"energy","identifier":"doe-85749222253","title":"Transparent Cost Database","description":"The Transparent Cost Database collects program cost and performance estimates for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy technologies in a public forum where they can be viewed and compared to other published estimates.

Taft IV stated in part: \"The year 1989-90 was a transitional period in international relations, as the world community continued to deal with implications of the end of the Cold War and the unsteady emergence of a new era. Many of the tensions and ambiguities of the time are reflected in the documents excerpted in this volume. For example, the Immigration Act of 1990 was adopted against the background of domestic U.S. concerns about terrorism, admission of refugees and exclusion of aliens-issues that continue to be important today. Other significant domestic law issues involved reservations to treaties (in this case, the 1948 Genocide Convention), the application of doctrines of foreign sovereign immunity (the Wallenberg Case), the interplay between sanctions and foreign assistance (e.g., Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic), and the allocation of foreign affairs authority in our federal system. \"At the same time, the volume records U.S. efforts to deal effectively with the legal dimensions of very diverse issues on the international plane, including the Iraqi attack on the U.S.S. Stark, the downing of Iran Air Flight 655, the deployment of U.S. armed forces in Panama, maritime interdiction incidents, irregular rendition of criminal suspects, and the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. Concerns about human rights, terrorism, and the war on drugs are indicated by the adoption of domestic legislation implementing, or relating to the implementation of, the UN Convention on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.","download_url":"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/documents\/organization\/139393.pdf","accessURL":null},{"agency_id":"state","identifier":"100686","title":"Digest of United States Practice in International Law 1991-1999","description":"The Office of the Legal Adviser publishes the annual Digest of United States Practice in International Law to provide the public with a historical record of the views and practice of the Government of the United States in public and private international law. In his introduction to the Digest covering 1991-1999, then Legal Adviser John B. Bellinger, III, summarized its contents, stating in part: \"During this period, for instance, the United States became party to important human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. International terrorist acts such as the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, posed new challenges, to which the United States responded through negotiation of new international terrorism conventions, efforts in both the UN Security Council and the International Court of Justice, and changes in U.S. domestic laws . . . . \"Legal issues involving the use of force arose with U.S. participation in the Gulf War and the military intervention in the territory of the Former Yugoslavia, and were addressed in several instances before the International Court of Justice. U.S. participation in the peace process and in peacekeeping in areas as diverse as the Middle East, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, and Haiti gave rise to both international and domestic legal issues. Major efforts were pursued in arms control and nuclear non-proliferation, including the establishment of the Korean Energy Development Organization. \"The 1990s were an era of new international institutions and political structures. The United States was actively engaged, for instance, in the Security Council's creation of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda and the UN Mission in Kosovo.","download_url":"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/documents\/organization\/139394.pdf","accessURL":null},{"agency_id":"state","identifier":"100687","title":"Digest of United States Practice in International Law 2000","description":"The Office of the Legal Adviser publishes the annual Digest of United States Practice in International Law to provide the public with a historical record of the views and practice of the Government of the United States in public and private international law.

In this field, as in so many other ways, the tragic, traumatic events of September 11 altered the landscape of U.S. practice. Issues of use of force, self-defense, and counter-terrorism, which have always been important, have posed unforeseen challenges in unanticipated contexts. Policy makers have been confronted by new questions related to humanitarian law, the law of war, and international criminal law. The various domestic and international responses to terrorism, including economic and trade sanctions, the freezing and seizing of assets, claims for compensation, and civil litigation, have each generated new and unique problems, to which the legal responses continue to develop. \"At the same time, 2001 witnessed many other significant developments not directly related to the events of September 11, both through United States participation in international fora and developments in the application of international law in the United States.

Taft IV stated in part: \"Calendar year 2002 gave rise to a broad range of significant and sometimes novel issues of international law. Many developments again highlighted the need to protect our national security against a different kind of enemy through the use of force in self-defense, non-proliferation and arms control efforts, the detention of unlawful enemy combatants and establishment of military commissions, continued counter-terrorism efforts, the imposition of sanctions, and the freezing of governmental assets, sometimes made available for payment of claims by individuals against terrorist states.

The military campaign to oust Saddam Hussein and his regime in Iraq and the continuing effort to locate Osama bin Laden and his supporters gave rise to many important legal issues, including those related to the lawful use of force, the response to international terrorism, and compliance with international humanitarian law. Beyond Iraq and Afghanistan, of course, many other situations affecting international security and stability generated complicated and sensitive issues for the world community and its lawyers. . . .\" \"The year was also marked by a series of significant cases and decisions in domestic courts and international tribunals related to international law and practice. The International Court of Justice in The Hague handed down its decision on preliminary measures in the Avena case brought by Mexico under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, as well as its judgment in the Oil Platforms case (Iran v. United States). By agreement the Lockerbie case (Libya v. United States) before the ICJ was discontinued. Ongoing litigation in our domestic courts concerned fundamental issues arising under two important U.S. statutes, the Alien Tort Statute of 1789 and the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

To provide but a few examples, the United States entered into the first agreements under the Proliferation Security Initiative, Secretary Powell testified to the commission of genocide in Darfur, and the U.S. Supreme Court issued two decisions relating to detention of enemy combatants. \"The United States also continued to be actively engaged, through negotiation of treaties, arbitrations, diplomatic initiatives, and domestic litigation, in legal issues related to global challenges including international criminal law, the law of the sea, environment, trade and investment, consular functions, privileges and immunities, international claims and state responsibility, commercial and family law, treaty practice, cultural property, and sanctions. In 2004, among other things, the United States undertook to implement a judgment of the International Court of Justice in Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v.

In one of his first actions after taking office, President Barack Obama unequivocally banned the use of torture as an instrument of U.S. policy and instructed that all interrogations of detainees be conducted in accordance with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and with the revised Army Field Manual. The executive branch also articulated a revised, narrower legal basis for its authority to detain individuals, based on the 2001 statutory Authorization for the Use of Military Force (\"AUMF\"), and made clear that its interpretation of the AUMF would be informed by the law of war. The administration also worked with Congress to improve the legal framework governing military commissions. The United States also pursued initiatives to renew the rule of law by reviving our treaty and agreement making process. For example, in 2009, we deposited or exchanged instruments of ratification to bring into force more than 70 advice and consent treaties, which is an all-time annual record for the United States. Among these treaties were crucial law of war instruments, tax treaties, an environmental treaty, and law enforcement treaties, including landmark agreements with the European Union on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, which entered into force in early 2010. In addition, we negotiated a new treaty to replace the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (\"START\"),.","download_url":"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/documents\/organization\/155452.pdf","accessURL":null},{"agency_id":"state","identifier":"100697","title":"Digest of United States Practice in International Law 2010","description":"The 2010 Digest provides a historical record of developments that took place during calendar year 2010, illustrating how the United States put our strategic vision of international law into practice. That concept rests on the principle that obeying international law promotes U.S. foreign policy interests and strengthens our international leadership. The United States' active participation in international tribunals and other international bodies formed an important part of our practice in 2010. Over the year, the United States continued to engage with the International Criminal Court while maintaining its active support for other international tribunals. The United States' active engagement with the Court and the parties to the Rome Statute has enabled us to help shape the direction of the Court to ensure that it fulfills its important mandate to bring to justice the perpetrators of mass atrocities. In the area of the law of armed conflict, the United States continued to place priority on ensuring that its detention operations, detainee prosecutions, and operations involving the use of force-including those in the armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces-are consistent with all applicable law, including international law. In January 2010, an interagency task force established by President Obama completed a comprehensive review of the status of all of the individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay when President Obama assumed office and made consensus determinations about the disposition of each detainee's case consistent with national security, the interests of justice, and the U.S. longstanding policy not to transfer any individual to a country where it is more likely than not he would be tortured. In habeas litigation brought by Guantanamo detainees in U.S. federal court, the United States continued to assert the 2001 statutory Authorization for Use of Military Force (\"AUMF\").","download_url":"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/documents\/organization\/179316.pdf","accessURL":null},{"agency_id":"state","identifier":"100698","title":"Digest of United States Practice in International Law 2011","description":"This volume provides a historical record of developments occurring during calendar year 2011, when the State Department's Office of the Legal Adviser marked its 80th birthday since its creation as a statutory entity.1 For the first time, the State Department is publishing the official version of the Digest exclusively on-line. By publishing the Digest on-line, we seek to make U.S. views on international law more quickly and readily accessible to our counterparts in other governments and international organizations, scholars, students, and other users, both within the United States and around the world. The Arab Awakening presented a variety of challenges for the practice of international law in 2011. In addressing events in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, and elsewhere, the United States government carefully applied what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called \"smart power,\" utilizing a wide array of foreign policy tools to fit the needs of the particular circumstance. In Libya, the U.S. took a multilateral approach, acting quickly at the UN Security Council to pass historic resolutions that established an arms embargo and sanctions regime and made the first ever unanimous referral to the International Criminal Court. Based on Security Council Resolution 1973's authorization for \"all necessary measures\" to enforce a no-fly zone, and consistent with the War Powers Resolution, the United States was part of a limited, NATO-led military mission in Libya. Various additional legal issues arose during the U.S. response to the situation in Libya, including those related to securing a protecting power, addressing the situation at the United Nations Human Rights Council, recognizing the new Libyan government, and arranging for funds to be made available to the new government using assets of the former regime that had been frozen pursuant to Security Council resolutions.

The OECD Gender Portal is thus a work in progress, that aims at progressively filling these gaps through new indicators. The last data release, for Women's Day 2013, includes new gender-sensitive indicators of job quality, timely indicators of labor market participation, indicators on top and low-achieving students in different subjects and on entrepreneurial culture.

Hazmat routes in the NTAD, are organized into 3 database files, hazmat.shp, hmroutes.dbf, and hmstcnty.dbf. Each record in each database represents a unique Tiger\/Line segment. These Tiger\/Line segments are grouped into routes identified as character strings in the ROUTE_ID field in the hmroutes.dbf table. The route name appearing in the ROUTE_ID is assigned by FMCSA and is unique for each State [this sentence could be deleted - it doesn't add a lot to it]. The hmstcnty.dbf table allows the user to select routes by State and County. A single shapefile, called hazmat.shp, represents geometry for all routes in the United States.","download_url":"","accessURL":""},{"agency_id":"dot","identifier":"31.0","title":"Hazmat Special Permits","description":"The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has the primary responsibility for the issuance of DOT Special Permits and Approvals to the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR).

For inventory purposes, installations are comprised of sites, where a site is defined as a specific geographic location of federally owned or managed land and is assigned to military installation.
