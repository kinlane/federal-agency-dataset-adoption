Many of the tensions and ambiguities of the time are reflected in the documents excerpted in this volume. For example, the Immigration Act of 1990 was adopted against the background of domestic U.S. concerns about terrorism, admission of refugees and exclusion of aliens-issues that continue to be important today. Other significant domestic law issues involved reservations to treaties (in this case, the 1948 Genocide Convention), the application of doctrines of foreign sovereign immunity (the Wallenberg Case), the interplay between sanctions and foreign assistance (e.g., Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic), and the allocation of foreign affairs authority in our federal system. \"At the same time, the volume records U.S. efforts to deal effectively with the legal dimensions of very diverse issues on the international plane, including the Iraqi attack on the U.S.S. Stark, the downing of Iran Air Flight 655, the deployment of U.S. armed forces in Panama, maritime interdiction incidents, irregular rendition of criminal suspects, and the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe.

International terrorist acts such as the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, posed new challenges, to which the United States responded through negotiation of new international terrorism conventions, efforts in both the UN Security Council and the International Court of Justice, and changes in U.S. domestic laws . . . . \"Legal issues involving the use of force arose with U.S. participation in the Gulf War and the military intervention in the territory of the Former Yugoslavia, and were addressed in several instances before the International Court of Justice. U.S. participation in the peace process and in peacekeeping in areas as diverse as the Middle East, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, and Haiti gave rise to both international and domestic legal issues. Major efforts were pursued in arms control and nuclear non-proliferation, including the establishment of the Korean Energy Development Organization. \"The 1990s were an era of new international institutions and political structures.

In this field, as in so many other ways, the tragic, traumatic events of September 11 altered the landscape of U.S. practice. Issues of use of force, self-defense, and counter-terrorism, which have always been important, have posed unforeseen challenges in unanticipated contexts. Policy makers have been confronted by new questions related to humanitarian law, the law of war, and international criminal law. The various domestic and international responses to terrorism, including economic and trade sanctions, the freezing and seizing of assets, claims for compensation, and civil litigation, have each generated new and unique problems, to which the legal responses continue to develop. \"At the same time, 2001 witnessed many other significant developments not directly related to the events of September 11, both through United States participation in international fora and developments in the application of international law in the United States. These cover the full range of topics in international legal practice, from treaties to consular affairs, the environment, and private international law. . . .\"","download_url":"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/documents\/organization\/139600.pdf","accessURL":null,"distribution":[],"adoptions":[]},{"unique":"375516e002aae7fb004fafa68e9dc1f5","agency_id":"state","identifier":"100689","title":"Digest of United States Practice in International Law 2002","slug":"digest-of-united-states-practice-in-international-law-2002","description":"The Office of the Legal Adviser publishes the annual Digest of United States Practice in International Law to provide the public with a historical record of the views and practice of the Government of the United States in public and private international law. \"In his introduction to the 2002 volume, then Legal Adviser William H.

Many developments again highlighted the need to protect our national security against a different kind of enemy through the use of force in self-defense, non-proliferation and arms control efforts, the detention of unlawful enemy combatants and establishment of military commissions, continued counter-terrorism efforts, the imposition of sanctions, and the freezing of governmental assets, sometimes made available for payment of claims by individuals against terrorist states.

The International Court of Justice in The Hague handed down its decision on preliminary measures in the Avena case brought by Mexico under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, as well as its judgment in the Oil Platforms case (Iran v. United States). By agreement the Lockerbie case (Libya v. United States) before the ICJ was discontinued. Ongoing litigation in our domestic courts concerned fundamental issues arising under two important U.S. statutes, the Alien Tort Statute of 1789 and the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Other cases began to address issues related to the status and rights of detainees in Guantanamo and the United States. Significant decisions were rendered in several cases by NAFTA tribunals.

To provide but a few examples, the United States entered into the first agreements under the Proliferation Security Initiative, Secretary Powell testified to the commission of genocide in Darfur, and the U.S. Supreme Court issued two decisions relating to detention of enemy combatants. \"The United States also continued to be actively engaged, through negotiation of treaties, arbitrations, diplomatic initiatives, and domestic litigation, in legal issues related to global challenges including international criminal law, the law of the sea, environment, trade and investment, consular functions, privileges and immunities, international claims and state responsibility, commercial and family law, treaty practice, cultural property, and sanctions. In 2004, among other things, the United States undertook to implement a judgment of the International Court of Justice in Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v.

Legal Adviser Harold Hongju Koh summarized the contents of the 2009 Digest, stating in part: In 2009, as this volume reflects, a new United States administration, under the Presidency of Barack Obama, took office and pursued important initiatives demonstrating its respect for the rule of law. For instance, the United States has sought to ensure its detention operations, detainee prosecutions, and uses of force are all consistent with the laws of war. In one of his first actions after taking office, President Barack Obama unequivocally banned the use of torture as an instrument of U.S. policy and instructed that all interrogations of detainees be conducted in accordance with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and with the revised Army Field Manual. The executive branch also articulated a revised, narrower legal basis for its authority to detain individuals, based on the 2001 statutory Authorization for the Use of Military Force (\"AUMF\"), and made clear that its interpretation of the AUMF would be informed by the law of war. The administration also worked with Congress to improve the legal framework governing military commissions. The United States also pursued initiatives to renew the rule of law by reviving our treaty and agreement making process. For example, in 2009, we deposited or exchanged instruments of ratification to bring into force more than 70 advice and consent treaties, which is an all-time annual record for the United States. Among these treaties were crucial law of war instruments, tax treaties, an environmental treaty, and law enforcement treaties, including landmark agreements with the European Union on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, which entered into force in early 2010. In addition, we negotiated a new treaty to replace the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (\"START\"),.","download_url":"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/documents\/organization\/155452.pdf","accessURL":null,"distribution":[],"adoptions":[]},{"unique":"0e916803379844c68dd8dc5663642336","agency_id":"state","identifier":"100697","title":"Digest of United States Practice in International Law 2010","slug":"digest-of-united-states-practice-in-international-law-2010","description":"The 2010 Digest provides a historical record of developments that took place during calendar year 2010, illustrating how the United States put our strategic vision of international law into practice. That concept rests on the principle that obeying international law promotes U.S. foreign policy interests and strengthens our international leadership. The United States' active participation in international tribunals and other international bodies formed an important part of our practice in 2010. Over the year, the United States continued to engage with the International Criminal Court while maintaining its active support for other international tribunals. The United States' active engagement with the Court and the parties to the Rome Statute has enabled us to help shape the direction of the Court to ensure that it fulfills its important mandate to bring to justice the perpetrators of mass atrocities. In the area of the law of armed conflict, the United States continued to place priority on ensuring that its detention operations, detainee prosecutions, and operations involving the use of force-including those in the armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces-are consistent with all applicable law, including international law. In January 2010, an interagency task force established by President Obama completed a comprehensive review of the status of all of the individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay when President Obama assumed office and made consensus determinations about the disposition of each detainee's case consistent with national security, the interests of justice, and the U.S. longstanding policy not to transfer any individual to a country where it is more likely than not he would be tortured.

By publishing the Digest on-line, we seek to make U.S. views on international law more quickly and readily accessible to our counterparts in other governments and international organizations, scholars, students, and other users, both within the United States and around the world. The Arab Awakening presented a variety of challenges for the practice of international law in 2011. In addressing events in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, and elsewhere, the United States government carefully applied what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called \"smart power,\" utilizing a wide array of foreign policy tools to fit the needs of the particular circumstance. In Libya, the U.S. took a multilateral approach, acting quickly at the UN Security Council to pass historic resolutions that established an arms embargo and sanctions regime and made the first ever unanimous referral to the International Criminal Court. Based on Security Council Resolution 1973's authorization for \"all necessary measures\" to enforce a no-fly zone, and consistent with the War Powers Resolution, the United States was part of a limited, NATO-led military mission in Libya. Various additional legal issues arose during the U.S. response to the situation in Libya, including those related to securing a protecting power, addressing the situation at the United Nations Human Rights Council, recognizing the new Libyan government, and arranging for funds to be made available to the new government using assets of the former regime that had been frozen pursuant to Security Council resolutions.

The Portal is part of the new OECD Gender Equality website www.oecd.org\/gender, which also features Closing the Gender Gap: Act Now, a publication that presents new analysis of the productivity losses caused by gender inequality and proposes policy solutions to close the gender gaps. While much progress has been accomplished in recent years, there are still relevant dimensions of gender inequalities that are poorly monitored and measured. The OECD Gender Portal is thus a work in progress, that aims at progressively filling these gaps through new indicators. The last data release, for Women's Day 2013, includes new gender-sensitive indicators of job quality, timely indicators of labor market participation, indicators on top and low-achieving students in different subjects and on entrepreneurial culture.
