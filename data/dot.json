Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a State as practicable.

The on-line NMHRR linkage is http:\/\/hazmat.fmcsa.dot.gov\/nhmrr\/index.asp With the exception of 13 features that were not identified with the Tiger\/Lines, Hazmat routes were created by extracting the TIGER\/Line segments that corresponded to each individual route. Hazmat routes in the NTAD, are organized into 3 database files, hazmat.shp, hmroutes.dbf, and hmstcnty.dbf. Each record in each database represents a unique Tiger\/Line segment. These Tiger\/Line segments are grouped into routes identified as character strings in the ROUTE_ID field in the hmroutes.dbf table. The route name appearing in the ROUTE_ID is assigned by FMCSA and is unique for each State [this sentence could be deleted - it doesn't add a lot to it]. The hmstcnty.dbf table allows the user to select routes by State and County. A single shapefile, called hazmat.shp, represents geometry for all routes in the United States.","download_url":"","accessURL":"","distribution":[{"format":"text\/html","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.bts.gov\/programs\/geographic_information_services\/"},{"format":"text\/html","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.rita.dot.gov\/bts\/sites\/rita.dot.gov.bts\/files\/publications\/national_transportation_atlas_database\/2013\/index.html"},{"format":"text\/html","accessURL":"https:\/\/1bts.rita.dot.gov\/pdc\/user\/products\/src\/products.xml?p=33470&c=-1"}]},{"unique":"a79ee54b671876828e878ebf6f3d78b3","agency_id":"dot","identifier":"31.0","title":"Hazmat Special Permits","slug":"hazmat-special-permits","description":"The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has the primary responsibility for the issuance of DOT Special Permits and Approvals to the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR).

This list does not necessarily represent a comprehensive collection of all Department of Defense facilities, and only those in the fifty United States and US Territories were considered for inclusion. For inventory purposes, installations are comprised of sites, where a site is defined as a specific geographic location of federally owned or managed land and is assigned to military installation.

RITA\/BTS Hydrographic data was integrated to create detailed shorelines. The TIGER\/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File \/ Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF\/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. States and equivalent entities are the primary governmental divisions of the United States. In addition to the fifty States, the Census Bureau treats the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and each of the Island Areas (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) as the statistical equivalents of States for the purpose of data presentation.","download_url":"","accessURL":"","distribution":[{"format":"text\/html","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.rita.dot.gov\/bts\/sites\/rita.dot.gov.bts\/files\/publications\/national_transportation_atlas_database\/2013\/index.html"},{"format":"text\/html","accessURL":"https:\/\/1bts.rita.dot.gov\/pdc\/user\/products\/src\/products.xml?p=33470&c=-1"}]},{"unique":"f23d10a41b58f4c7f8e11afb531bd186","agency_id":"dot","identifier":"1a157f3f-f6d0-4073-9266-af0820768c38","title":"Ports (National)","slug":"ports-national","description":"Contains physical information on commercial facilities at the principal U.S. Coastal, Great Lakes and Inland Ports (NTAD 2013).
