These data provide comprehensive and accurate information on milk supplies, utilization, and sales, as well as class prices established under the orders and prices paid to dairy farmers (producers). The sources of this data are monthly reports of receipts and utilization, producer payroll reports, and reports of nonpool handlers filed by milk processors (handlers) subject to the provisions of the various milk orders. The local market administrator (MA) uses these reports to determine pool obligations under the order and to verify proper payments to producers. Auditors employed by the MA review handler records to assure the accuracy of reported information. Reporting errors are corrected; if necessary, pool obligations are revised.\r\rAfter the pool obligations have been determined the local market administrator summarizes the individual handler reports and submits a series of order summary reports to the Market Information Branch (MIB) in Dairy Programs. The MIB summarizes the individual order data and disseminates this information via monthly, bimonthly, and annual releases or publications. Since milk marketing order statistics are based on reports filed by the population of possible reporting firms and not a sample, these statistics are comprehensive. Also, since these individual firm reports are subject to audit and verification, these statistics are accurate.\r\rThe Federal milk order statistics database contains historical information, beginning in January 2000, generated by the administration of the Federal milk order program. Most of the information in the database has been published previously by the Market Information Branch in Dairy Programs either on its web site or in the Dairy Market News Report.

The Summer Food Service Program is designed to fill that nutrition gap and make sure children can get the nutritious meals they need.  This data set contains information on summer food service participation, meals served and cash payments provided by state.

Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS Enterprise Data Warehouse. Forests and\/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features.The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Using the FCODE attribute, streams\/rivers\/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent\/ephemeral types. Linear features (streams & rivers) FCODES 46003 and 46006 and polygonal features (lakes and other waterbody) FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43612, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittentt\/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. Underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are exlcuded. Initially, all intermittent\/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest\/Region units. Subsequently, Forest\/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. The resulting avoidance areas may have overlapping features due to the buffering processes.The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000\/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.","download_url":"","accessURL":null},{"unique":"6acf5831232607abf5150bb025f6ef81","agency_id":"usda","identifier":"a13fdd96-630c-4251-851d-ced9ab0047b3","title":"U.S. Forest Service Aerial Fire Retardant Avoidance Areas","description":"A map service depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas delivered as part of the 2011 Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land Environmental Impact Statement.

Data includes location of terrestrial and hydrographic areas where the application of aerial fire retardant is to be avoided. Current aerial fire retardant standards prohibit application within 300 feet of hydrographic features.

This tabular dataset is meant to be joined with the NRCS Watershed Boundary Dataset HUC-12. The results of this assessment provides information that can identify areas of interest for protecting surface drinking water quality. The spatial dataset can be incorporated into broad-scale planning, such as the State Forest Action Plans, and can be incorporated into existing decision support tools that currently lack spatial data on important areas for surface drinking water. This project also sets the groundwork for identifying watersheds where a payment for watershed services (PWS) scheme may be an option for financing forest conservation and management on private unprotected forest lands. In perhaps its most important but most basic role, this work can serve as an education tool helping to illustrate the link between forests and provision of key watershed-based ecosystem services.","download_url":"","accessURL":null},{"unique":"5fa7e61d9f2bd2be9efab728acad9f51","agency_id":"usda","identifier":"8700be05-1a23-45e6-91a0-6cfa3045a694","title":"U.S. Forest Service Geopolitical Units","description":"A map service on the www depicting geopolitical data for the entire area of the United States and territories.

Enter a state to see a station count.\r\n\r\n## Data Collection Methods ##\r\n\r\nThe data in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) obtains information about new stations from trade media, Clean Cities coordinators, an Add a Station form on the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) website, and through collaborating with infrastructure equipment and fuel providers.\r\n\r\nNREL regularly compares its station data with those of other relevant trade organizations and websites. Differences in methodologies and inclusion criteria may result in slight differences between NREL's database and those maintained by other organizations. NREL also collaborates with alternative fuel industry groups to maintain the data. NREL and its data collection subcontractor are currently collaborating with natural gas, electric drive, biodiesel, ethanol, and propane industry groups to establish best practices for identifying new stations in the most-timely manner possible and to develop a more rigorous network for the future.\r\n\r\n## Station Update Schedule ##\r\n\r\nExisting stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified. Based on an established data collection schedule, the database is updated once a month with the exception of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) data, which are updated twice a month. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database on a monthly basis or as they are identified.\r\n\r\n## Mapping and Counting Methods ##\r\n\r\nEach point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. A station appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of fuel dispensers or charging outlets at that location. Station addresses are geocoded and mapped using an automatic geocoding application. The geocoding application returns the most accurate location based on the provided address. Station locations may also be provided by external sources (e.g., station operators) and\/or verified in a geographic information system (GIS) tool like Google Earth, Google Maps, or Google StreetView. This information is considered highly accurate, and these coordinates override any information generated using the geocoding application.\r\n\r\n## Notes about Specific Station Types ##\r\n### Private Stations ###\r\nStations with an Access of \"Private - Fleet customers only\" may allow other entities to fuel through a business-to-business arrangement. For more information, fleet customers should refer to the information listed in the details section for that station to contact the station directly.\r\n\r\n### Biodiesel Stations ###\r\nThe Alternative Fueling Station Locator only includes stations offering biodiesel blends of 20% (B20) and above.\r\n\r\n### Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) ###\r\nAn electric charging station, or EVSE, appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of charging outlets at that location. The number and type of charging outlets available are displayed as additional details when the station location is selected. Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. To see a total count of EVSE for all outlets available, go to the Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State table. Residential EVSE locations are not included in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator.\r\n\r\n## Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations ###\r\nBecause many propane stations serve customers other than drivers and fleets, NREL collaborated with the industry to effectively represent the differences. Each propane station is designated as a 'primary' or 'secondary' service type. Both types are able to fuel vehicles. However, locations with a 'primary' designation offer vehicle services and fuel priced specifically for use in vehicles. The details page for each station lists its service designation.\r\n","download_url":"","accessURL":null},{"unique":"a96b38046e9522824db837bbaeedf6f8","agency_id":"energy","identifier":"DOE-2332","title":"Alternative Transportation Fuels (ATF) and

Detailed travel behavior information was obtained from more than 42,500 households via multiple data-collection methods, including computer-assisted telephone interviewing, online and mail surveys, wearable and in-vehicle GPS, and on-board diagnostic (OBD) sensors that gathered data directly from a vehicle's engine. Details of personal travel behavior were gathered within the region of residence, inter-regionally within the state, and in adjoining states and Mexico. The survey sampling plan was designed to ensure an accurate representation of the entire population of the state.\r\n\r\nThe CHTS included additional features\u2014more detailed data on vehicle-acquisition decisions, parking choices, work schedules and flexibility, use of toll lanes\/priced facilities, and walk and bicycle trips\u2014to support advanced model development.\r\n\r\n## GPS Data Logger\/On-Board Diagnostic Sensor ##\r\n\r\nThe GPS device used in the vehicle-based portion of the study and to support OBD data collection was the QStarz BT-Q1000x travel recorder, which recorded data at 1-second intervals. Additionally, a CarChip Fleet Pro OBD sensor was used in coordination with the in-vehicle GPS to collect vehicle speed, air-flow rate, throttle position, engine load, and engine speed in 5-second intervals. For the wearable portion of the study, the GlobalSat GPS data logger was used. This device was programmed to collect data at 3-second intervals and to record all GPS points where the speed was greater than one mph.","download_url":"","accessURL":null},{"unique":"d771a6616cb6a910f69bf6de95108ccf","agency_id":"energy","identifier":"DOE-4824","title":"Coal Production by MSHA ID, Mine Operation, and Union Status, 1991","description":"Coal Production Data Files contain information which identify the mining operation (i.e., operation name, mailing address, telephone number, State and county of operation, etc.), annual coal production, and code definitions.

SciTech Connect is a consolidation of two core DOE search engines, the Information Bridge and the Energy Citations Database. SciTech Connect incorporates all of the R&D information from these two products into one search interface. SciTech Connect was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) to increase access to science, technology, and engineering research information from DOE and its predecessor agencies.\nSciTech Connect contains all the full-text documents and citations previously found in Information Bridge and Energy Citations Database. Thus, SciTech Connect contains over sixty-five years of energy-related citations created and\/or collected by OSTI. \n\nSciTech Connect includes technical reports, bibliographic citations, journal articles, conference papers, books, multimedia, and data information sponsored by DOE through a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or similar type of funding mechanism from the 1940s to today. This collection continues to grow as new scientific and technical information resulting from DOE research becomes available. \n\nThere are over 2.5 million citations, including citations to 1.4 million journal articles, 364,000 of which have digital object identifiers (DOIs) linking to full-text articles on publishers' websites. SciTech Connect also has over 313,000 full-text DOE sponsored STI reports; most of these are post-1991, but close to 85,000 of the reports were published prior to 1990.\nThe SciTech Connect Basic Search utilizes a semantic search technique called keyword-to-concept mapping. Your search term will be mapped to related scientific concepts allowing you to retrieve results related to your search term, but also to explore narrower and similar concepts.","download_url":"","accessURL":null},{"unique":"5b960b99d696ec8ee69d306043732bf2","agency_id":"energy","identifier":"DOE-30131","title":"SciTech Connect Data Service","description":"Contains bibliographic data for the SciTech Connect Database providing access to historical and current research (1948 to the present) from the Department of Energy (DOE) and predecessor agencies, plus other energy-related information.

Data for the project are voluntarily contributed from a variety of sources including utilities, installers, and the general public. The data collected is actively maintained by the contributors and are always changing to provide an evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the US solar power market.\r\n\r\n![Image of solar deployments on a map](https:\/\/openpv.nrel.gov\/assets\/img\/viz_slideshow\/timeMapper_panel.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Data Collection #\r\n\r\nThe Open PV Project is collecting data from any willing contributor of available information. NREL has \"seeded\" the Open PV database by requesting data from most state run incentive programs, large utilities, and other organizations. This initial data collection has provided a solid base of data for the project to launch from and it is our hope that the database will continue to grow through contributions from the PV community and anyone interested in understanding PV market dynamics in the US.\r\n\r\n## Data Quality ##\r\n\r\nDetermining the quality of incoming data is dependent upon who is submitting the data to the project. This means that data coming from users associated with a particular organization may be \"trusted\" more than data from other unknown users. Each registered user is assigned a default \"score\" based on their organizational affiliation. This score is highest for Government users (State, Federal, etc.) because such users are often involved with incentive programs that have a defined data collection process in place. Second are utility and PV installers (and others in the PV industry), and so on. All users who contribute data to the project have the ability to gain a \"project reputation\" that can impact the score of the data they contribute.\r\n\r\n## Validation ##\r\n\r\nData validation occurs on each record in the database on a regular basis. The database is continually analyzed for corrupt records, bad or invalid data, and outliers such as an abnormal cost to watt ratio. Records found to contain questionable data are flagged and are dealt with on a case by case basis by a member of the Open PV Team.\r\n\r\n## Duplication ##\r\n\r\nUnderstanding duplication is one of the ways that individual records are validated. In a publicly contributed database, it is imperative to anticipate the submission of duplicate records. When duplicate records are detected, they are added to an install specific list of duplicates and the data provided are aggregated into \"summary records\" of their respective installs. Identifying duplicate records helps validate PV installs in the database. The more a PV installation is duplicated in the database, the more trust the project places on the data for that installation.\r\n\r\n# Data Fields #\r\n## Required Fields ##\r\n\r\nThe Open PV Project is designed to be able to store nearly any type of information pertaining to PV installations. In order to provide the primary statistics from the database we have identified 4 data fields that are required of each PV install added to the project. These four fields are:\r\n\r\n-  Date Installed (Completion date or interconnection date)\r\n-  Size\/Capacity of the PV Installation (in kW DC)\r\n-  Location (Zipcode or Street Address)\r\n-  Total Installed Cost (in USD, before incentives)\r\n\r\n## Additional Fields ##\r\n\r\nThe four required fields listed above provide the Open PV Project with the base information needed to derive several key statistics on the US PV market, including historical trends and regional comparisons. However, the design of the Open PV database is capable of storing nearly any type of data associated with PV installation, so the Open PV Team would like to encourage you to contribute any additional information you are comfortable sharing. This extra information can be extremely valuable, for example, data that contains information about who installed the PV installation can help to answer very useful questions about where certain installers are working. Information on module or inverter types can be useful in mapping efficiency and detailed financing information can be a key factor in understanding trends in overall installation cost. The Open PV Team strongly encourages you to contribute any data you feel comfortable providing, especially data you would like to see visualized in our gallery someday.","download_url":"","accessURL":null},{"unique":"d92cfe88d738ab1c2d7d905f2bb1d5b4","agency_id":"energy","identifier":"doe-85749222253","title":"Transparent Cost Database","description":"The Transparent Cost Database collects program cost and performance estimates for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy technologies in a public forum where they can be viewed and compared to other published estimates.
