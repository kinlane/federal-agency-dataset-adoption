[{"unique":"28d0854fba02e7ac2b51f58ea914f632","agency_id":"energy","identifier":"doe-47372010836","title":"Alternative Fuels Data Center","description":"Find alternative fueling stations near an address or ZIP code or along a route in the United States. Enter a state to see a station count.\r\n\r\n## Data Collection Methods ##\r\n\r\nThe data in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) obtains information about new stations from trade media, Clean Cities coordinators, an Add a Station form on the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) website, and through collaborating with infrastructure equipment and fuel providers.\r\n\r\nNREL regularly compares its station data with those of other relevant trade organizations and websites. Differences in methodologies and inclusion criteria may result in slight differences between NREL's database and those maintained by other organizations. NREL also collaborates with alternative fuel industry groups to maintain the data. NREL and its data collection subcontractor are currently collaborating with natural gas, electric drive, biodiesel, ethanol, and propane industry groups to establish best practices for identifying new stations in the most-timely manner possible and to develop a more rigorous network for the future.\r\n\r\n## Station Update Schedule ##\r\n\r\nExisting stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified. Based on an established data collection schedule, the database is updated once a month with the exception of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) data, which are updated twice a month. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database on a monthly basis or as they are identified.\r\n\r\n## Mapping and Counting Methods ##\r\n\r\nEach point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. A station appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of fuel dispensers or charging outlets at that location. Station addresses are geocoded and mapped using an automatic geocoding application. The geocoding application returns the most accurate location based on the provided address. Station locations may also be provided by external sources (e.g., station operators) and\/or verified in a geographic information system (GIS) tool like Google Earth, Google Maps, or Google StreetView. This information is considered highly accurate, and these coordinates override any information generated using the geocoding application.\r\n\r\n## Notes about Specific Station Types ##\r\n### Private Stations ###\r\nStations with an Access of \"Private - Fleet customers only\" may allow other entities to fuel through a business-to-business arrangement. For more information, fleet customers should refer to the information listed in the details section for that station to contact the station directly.\r\n\r\n### Biodiesel Stations ###\r\nThe Alternative Fueling Station Locator only includes stations offering biodiesel blends of 20% (B20) and above.\r\n\r\n### Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) ###\r\nAn electric charging station, or EVSE, appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of charging outlets at that location. The number and type of charging outlets available are displayed as additional details when the station location is selected. Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. To see a total count of EVSE for all outlets available, go to the Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State table. Residential EVSE locations are not included in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator.\r\n\r\n## Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations ###\r\nBecause many propane stations serve customers other than drivers and fleets, NREL collaborated with the industry to effectively represent the differences. Each propane station is designated as a 'primary' or 'secondary' service type. Both types are able to fuel vehicles. However, locations with a 'primary' designation offer vehicle services and fuel priced specifically for use in vehicles. The details page for each station lists its service designation.\r\n","download_url":"","accessURL":null,"distribution":[{"format":"api","accessURL":""},{"format":"text\/html","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.afdc.energy.gov\/data_download\/"}]},{"unique":"a96b38046e9522824db837bbaeedf6f8","agency_id":"energy","identifier":"DOE-2332","title":"Alternative

Detailed travel behavior information was obtained from more than 42,500 households via multiple data-collection methods, including computer-assisted telephone interviewing, online and mail surveys, wearable and in-vehicle GPS, and on-board diagnostic (OBD) sensors that gathered data directly from a vehicle's engine. Details of personal travel behavior were gathered within the region of residence, inter-regionally within the state, and in adjoining states and Mexico. The survey sampling plan was designed to ensure an accurate representation of the entire population of the state.\r\n\r\nThe CHTS included additional features\u2014more detailed data on vehicle-acquisition decisions, parking choices, work schedules and flexibility, use of toll lanes\/priced facilities, and walk and bicycle trips\u2014to support advanced model development.\r\n\r\n## GPS Data Logger\/On-Board Diagnostic Sensor ##\r\n\r\nThe GPS device used in the vehicle-based portion of the study and to support OBD data collection was the QStarz BT-Q1000x travel recorder, which recorded data at 1-second intervals. Additionally, a CarChip Fleet Pro OBD sensor was used in coordination with the in-vehicle GPS to collect vehicle speed, air-flow rate, throttle position, engine load, and engine speed in 5-second intervals.

This includes information on the type of facility assessed (size, industry, energy usage, etc.) and details of resulting recommendations (type, energy & dollars savings etc.).\r\n\r\nAs of 11-06-2013, the IAC database contains:\r\n  - 16,208 Assessments\r\n  - 121,978 Recommendations\r\n\r\nThe Database can be searched by:\r\n  - Assessments: Industry Type, Size, Year, Energy Costs, Products\r\n  - Recommendations: Type, Savings, Cost, Implemented\r\n  - Industry Type: SIC and NAICS\r\n  - A Recommendation Index is available for all assessment recommendation codes (ARC)\r\n\r\nNationwide locations of assessments and recommendations can be mapped using IAC Geography\r\n\r\nTop Ten lists of assessments and recommendations can be generated for specific criteria\r\n\r\n** What is the IAC? **\r\nWhat is meant by the term industrial assessment? An industrial assessment is, quite simply, an in-depth assessment of a plant site; its facilities, services and manufacturing operations. This term is used to refer to a process which involves a thorough examination of potential savings from:\r\n\r\n  - energy efficiency improvements\r\n  - waste minimization and pollution prevention\r\n  - productivity improvement\r\n\r\nAssessments are performed by local teams of engineering faculty and students from 24 centers and 32 participating universities across the country.\r\n\r\nThe assessment begins with a university-based IAC team conducting a survey of the eligible plant, followed by a one or two day site visit, taking engineering measurements as a basis for assessment recommendations. The team then performs a detailed analysis for specific recommendations with related estimates of costs, performance and payback times.\r\n\r\nWithin 60 days, a confidential report, detailing the analysis, findings and recommendations of the team is sent to the plant. In two to six months, follow-up phone calls are placed to the plant manager to verify recommendations that will be implemented.","download_url":"","accessURL":null,"distribution":[{"format":"application\/zip","accessURL":"http:\/\/iac.rutgers.edu\/download_db\/IAC_Database.zip"}]},{"unique":"e7e1b2d441c2373eef8e414318698ce5","agency_id":"energy","identifier":"DOE-5293","title":"International Energy Outlook Table Browser","description":"The International Energy Outlook 2013 presents EIA's long-term assessment of world energy markets.

Data for the project are voluntarily contributed from a variety of sources including utilities, installers, and the general public. The data collected is actively maintained by the contributors and are always changing to provide an evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the US solar power market.\r\n\r\n![Image of solar deployments on a map](https:\/\/openpv.nrel.gov\/assets\/img\/viz_slideshow\/timeMapper_panel.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Data Collection #\r\n\r\nThe Open PV Project is collecting data from any willing contributor of available information. NREL has \"seeded\" the Open PV database by requesting data from most state run incentive programs, large utilities, and other organizations. This initial data collection has provided a solid base of data for the project to launch from and it is our hope that the database will continue to grow through contributions from the PV community and anyone interested in understanding PV market dynamics in the US.\r\n\r\n## Data Quality ##\r\n\r\nDetermining the quality of incoming data is dependent upon who is submitting the data to the project. This means that data coming from users associated with a particular organization may be \"trusted\" more than data from other unknown users. Each registered user is assigned a default \"score\" based on their organizational affiliation. This score is highest for Government users (State, Federal, etc.) because such users are often involved with incentive programs that have a defined data collection process in place. Second are utility and PV installers (and others in the PV industry), and so on. All users who contribute data to the project have the ability to gain a \"project reputation\" that can impact the score of the data they contribute.\r\n\r\n## Validation ##\r\n\r\nData validation occurs on each record in the database on a regular basis. The database is continually analyzed for corrupt records, bad or invalid data, and outliers such as an abnormal cost to watt ratio. Records found to contain questionable data are flagged and are dealt with on a case by case basis by a member of the Open PV Team.\r\n\r\n## Duplication ##\r\n\r\nUnderstanding duplication is one of the ways that individual records are validated. In a publicly contributed database, it is imperative to anticipate the submission of duplicate records. When duplicate records are detected, they are added to an install specific list of duplicates and the data provided are aggregated into \"summary records\" of their respective installs. Identifying duplicate records helps validate PV installs in the database. The more a PV installation is duplicated in the database, the more trust the project places on the data for that installation.\r\n\r\n# Data Fields #\r\n## Required Fields ##\r\n\r\nThe Open PV Project is designed to be able to store nearly any type of information pertaining to PV installations. In order to provide the primary statistics from the database we have identified 4 data fields that are required of each PV install added to the project. These four fields are:\r\n\r\n-  Date Installed (Completion date or interconnection date)\r\n-  Size\/Capacity of the PV Installation (in kW DC)\r\n-  Location (Zipcode or Street Address)\r\n-  Total Installed Cost (in USD, before incentives)\r\n\r\n## Additional Fields ##\r\n\r\nThe four required fields listed above provide the Open PV Project with the base information needed to derive several key statistics on the US PV market, including historical trends and regional comparisons. However, the design of the Open PV database is capable of storing nearly any type of data associated with PV installation, so the Open PV Team would like to encourage you to contribute any additional information you are comfortable sharing. This extra information can be extremely valuable, for example, data that contains information about who installed the PV installation can help to answer very useful questions about where certain installers are working. Information on module or inverter types can be useful in mapping efficiency and detailed financing information can be a key factor in understanding trends in overall installation cost. The Open PV Team strongly encourages you to contribute any data you feel comfortable providing, especially data you would like to see visualized in our gallery someday.","download_url":"","accessURL":null,"distribution":[{"format":"text\/html","accessURL":"https:\/\/openpv.nrel.gov\/search"},{"format":"text\/html","accessURL":"https:\/\/openpv.nrel.gov\/api.php"}]},{"unique":"d92cfe88d738ab1c2d7d905f2bb1d5b4","agency_id":"energy","identifier":"doe-85749222253","title":"Transparent Cost Database","description":"The Transparent Cost Database collects program cost and performance estimates for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy technologies in a public forum where they can be viewed and compared to other published estimates.
