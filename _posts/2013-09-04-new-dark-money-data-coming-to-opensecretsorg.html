<p>For more than a year-and-a-half, the Center for Responsive Politics has been tracking the activities of dark money groups -- predominantly 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations and 501(c)(6) trade associations that have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into national elections over the last three election cycles without disclosing their donors.  Today, we have made a few updates to the existing Political Nonprofits section before we add a major component to the existing data.Todays updates include tens of millions of dollars in grants to and from the politically active nonprofits and their affiliates, which brings the total of grants weve been able to uncover to nearly $277 million.Weve also added date-specific markers to the Top Donors and Top Recipients pages that illustrate the period of time covered by each groups grants given and received.  With this done, were prepping the release of an entirely new set of data that will, for the first time, offer more complete financial information for hundreds of politically active nonprofits and their donors.</p>
