<p>
     Some of the smart people in Washington D.C. have decided to <a href="http://api.data.gov/about/">roll their own API management solution</a>, providing their own open source solution to many of the common problems faced by API providers like issuing API keys, rate limit and provide analytics.
</p>
<p>
     Available at <a href="http://api.data.gov/about/">api.data.gov/about</a>, but powered by an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/">API Umbrella</a>, the project aims to be a free and open API management option for federal agencies.
</p>
<p>
     API Umbrella provides some of the most common aspects of API management:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Documentation
     </li>
     <li>API Keys
     </li>
     <li>Rate Limiting
     </li>
     <li>Analytics
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The roadmap for API Umbrella is also interesting, looking to deliver:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Self-service web admin
     </li>
     <li>Interactive documentation
     </li>
     <li>User management
     </li>
     <li>Granular permissions and rate limits
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     While creating, yet another API management solution may not seem like the best idea at first, I can see why federal agencies would do it. Because of terms of use, costs and vendor lock-in with proprietary solutions, they are just seeking a simpler, cost effective alternative to solutions available in the private sector.
</p>
<p>
     I'd love to see a blueprint established for the features available in API Umbrella, the current implementation for the gatekeeper is in Node.js and the web interface is in Ruby--it would be nice to have an open blueprint which would allow for others to contribute PHP, Python and other iterations of the same model. Providing a way for organizations to choose an option that fits with the resources they have available, while still providing interoperability.
</p>
<p>
     It would also be great to see other city, county and state organizations adopt, deploy and evolve API Umbrella, providing a solution for other types of government organizations. I'm not intimate with the various needs of different types of government, but I'm sure there are some nuances that might make a difference.
</p>
<p>
     As I ramp up my time working in DC this year I will spend more time getting intimate with <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/">API Umbrella</a>, as well as other open data portal solutions like <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, and hopefully provide more resources on putting these solutions to use in the real world.
