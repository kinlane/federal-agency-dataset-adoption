<p>For the third year running, the Guardian has investigated how much was donated to gatherings of MPs and Lords known as all-party parliamentary groups.With the help of ScraperWiki the Datablog has again compiled a document bringing together hundreds of separate disclosure reports from all-party parliamentary groups.Donations to APPGs amount to £2.2m, £600,000 more than when the Guardian last completed the exercise in 2012, and £800,000 more – 50% – than when it was first conducted in the first year of the coalition.Other key highlights from todays story include: • A grant of £65,000 from BT to support the parliament choir.</p>
