<p>We are humbled to see that the White House drafted and released the official Open Data Policy of the United States on GitHub!The Presidential Memorandum calls for the creation of the aptly named Project Open Data, with the goal of making government data available, discoverable, and usable – in a word, open.Todays news marks the first time a government entity has published law as a living, collaborative document.Were excited to see how the Open Data Policy evolves with the input of the community, and we hope this is just the first of many.By choosing GitHub Pages, government employees as well as citizens are empowered to continuously propose and discuss potential improvements, creating a living policy document to unlock the potential of government data.</p>
