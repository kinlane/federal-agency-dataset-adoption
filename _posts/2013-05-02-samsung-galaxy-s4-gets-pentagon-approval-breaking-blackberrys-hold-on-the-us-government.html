<p>Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S4 has received security approval from the US Department of Defense (DoD), making it the company’s first device to gain US government certification.The endorsement also covers Samsung’s Knox security system and clears the way for the device to be used as part of a new policy for US government staff, as Korea’s Yonhap News reports.This approval is in line with a DoD announcement from February that will open its communications networks to smartphones and tablets from Apple and Google by February 2014.Samsung’s news come one day after BlackBerry announced that the DoD had cleared its new line of BlackBerry 10 phones, and its existing line of PlayBook tablets for use.That news was a boost to the struggling Canadian device maker, but it will have to make do with sharing its position in government with Samsung and Apple; a DoD spokesperson said the latter’s iPhone and iPad devices should gain approval this month.</p>
