<p>Officials with the Department of Veterans Affairs likely won’t acknowledge it publicly until later this year, but those responsible for processing disability claims believe the infamous “backlog” peaked more than two months ago.Last week, the total number of claims in the inventory fell to slightly more than 830,000—the lowest number since October 2011.Since late March, the backlog of claims has been on an eight-week slide as well.Last week, it too reached its lowest point since January 2012—nearly 17 months ago.The downward slope is now steeper than at any time during the Obama administration.</p>
