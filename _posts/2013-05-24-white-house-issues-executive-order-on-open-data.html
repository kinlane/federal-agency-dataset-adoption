<p>This week marks the one-year anniversary of the Digital Government Strategy, and we want to take a moment to reflect on a recent White House Executive Order about open data.This Executive Order and accompanying Open Data Policy [PDF 6MB] requires that, going forward, all data generated by the federal government be made available in ways that make the data easy to find, accessible, and usable (read about it in this blog post). Executive orders are official actions through which the President of the United States manages the operations of the federal government.This Executive Order has implications for all of us.What does “open data” mean?</p>
