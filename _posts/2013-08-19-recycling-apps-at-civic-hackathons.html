<p>With the sheer number of civic hackathons starting to reach a critical mass, some are asking whether the energy and drive embodied by these events can be directed to reusing existing applications or projects started at earlier events.This is an important issue, as some projects worked on at civic hacking events aren’t actively pursued after the event is over.Is there an opportunity to better focus the energy and talents of civic hackers to reuse existing applications, or to take the work from previous hackathons further?In attempting to answer this question, it should be noted that the very fact it’s being discussed demonstrates that the concept of hackathons is maturing.Civic hacking organizers are becoming increasingly creative in how events are organized and structured, and it makes sense to consider approaches that might produce more sustainable results.</p>
