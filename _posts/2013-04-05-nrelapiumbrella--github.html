<p>Make life easier for API creators: Allow API creators to focus on building APIs.Standardize the boring stuff: APIs can assume the boring stuff (access control, rate limiting, analytics, etc.) is already taken care if the API is being accessed, so common functionality doesnt need to be implemented in the API code.Easy to add: API Umbrella acts as a layer above your APIs, so your API code doesnt need to be modified to take advantage of the features provided.Scalability: Make it easier to scale your APIs.</p>
