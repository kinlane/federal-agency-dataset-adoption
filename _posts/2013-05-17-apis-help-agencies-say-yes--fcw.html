<p>The White House’s Digital Government Strategy calls on federal agencies to roll out two application programming interfaces (APIs) that make high-value data and content available to the masses by May 23, the strategys one-year milestone.But several agencies made sure not to wait until the last minute to release their tools for sharing content and data between communities and applications, and some of the government’s best examples of API development were on display during a May 15 mobile development panel discussion at the FOSE trade show.For example, the Census Bureau’s open-data API -- which General Services Administration Senior API Strategist Gray Brooks called the best API rollout of the past year -- makes key demographic, socioeconomic and housing data easily accessible to the public and developers, allowing them to create a slew of mobile applications with the data.The bureau’s API includes statistics on population, sex, age, race, household relationship, and homeowner or renter status down to geographic blocks, and the information available goes back to the 1990 census, meaning three decades of data can now be compared.Developers can create applications with those datasets that could, for instance, highlight commuting patterns by jurisdiction or provide local governments with a snapshot of an area’s socioeconomic diversity.</p>
