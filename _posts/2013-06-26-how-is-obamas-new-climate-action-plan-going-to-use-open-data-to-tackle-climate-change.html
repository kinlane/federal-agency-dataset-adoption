<p>Last night US President Barack Obama announced a major new action plan to fight climate change.The plan includes measures to regulate coal, cut emissions in many areas, boost green energy, increase climate resilience as well as to take stronger international leadership in achieving carbon emissions cuts.We were delighted to see that the plan includes using open data to tackle climate change.In particular it announces a new ‘Climate Data Initiative’, which is described as follows: Consistent with the President’s May 2013 Executive Order on Open Data – and recognizing that freely available open government data can fuel entrepreneurship, innovation, scientific discovery, and public benefits – the Administration is launching a Climate Data Initiative to leverage extensive federal climate-relevant data to stimulate innovation and private-sector entrepreneurship in support of national climate-change preparedness.This would inform the development of “a virtual climate resilience toolkit that centralizes access to data-driven resilience tools, services, and best practices”, including things like tools for risk-analysis for coastal areas.</p>
