     The federal government shutdown today. At the Department of Veterans Affairs we are still working through next monday, so it was business as usual today for me.
</p>
<p>
     One of my projects is preparing a list of APIs and data assets for a hackathon in NYC that is focusing on developing apps for veterans, called <a href="http://feastongood.com/2013/conference/hackathon">The Feast</a>. My goal is to aggregate a list of as many usable assets as possible so developers don't have to go to multiple locations to locate them.
</p>
<p>
     Many of the assets are available at <a title="VA.gov" href="http://www.va.gov/">VA.Gov</a>, but there are others that I knew were on <a title="Data.gov" href="http://data.gov">Data.Gov</a>. As soon as the page loaded at Data.Gov, I got a friendly message:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available. We sincerely regret this inconvenience.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     Basically, no data for me. No datasets for download, no APIs allowing me access information. Which leaves me questioning the entire reason I'm in government. I came here to open up data and build APIs, then convince you to use them in your applications, widgets, visualizations and other innovation projects.
</p>
<p>
     It is my way to find a way around <span class="c2">ANY</span> obstacle. There is nothing that will stop me. I will keep working no matter what. However, this is a pretty big obstacle, something that makes me question my faith in APIs in government. I can deal with just about anything, but if I evangelize APIs, that can be turned off at any point, for an unknown amount of time? Ummmâ€¦WTF? Unnacceptable!!
</p>
<p>
     There is always a work-around. I will find a solution that will work for me(and you), but it leaves me questioning quite a bit about this API evangelism from within the federal government.
