<p>In the United States an increasing number of companies are being founded with a mission to provide sophisticated digital services designed to simplify and improve civic life.Since 2011 over $431 million has been invested in a burgeoning new sector – ICT-based companies which are active in a variety of different sectors but united by the same concern: to improve civic life on a day-to-day basis.A report, entitled The Emergence of Civic Tech: Investments in a Growing Field, compiled by the Miami-based private non-profit Knight Foundation in conjunction with Quid,aSan Francisco-based firm that specializes in data analytics and network analysis, describes this complex ecosystem and highlights the profiles of the investors behind this steadfast rise.The report’s authors have tried to shed some light on this as yet fringe market, providing a broad picture of the companies working in this space, which they dub ‘civic tech’.Included in the list are all startups providing tools that enable citizens to interact more effectively with their governments, foster democratic dialogue or promote transparency and openness in the management of public affairs.</p>
