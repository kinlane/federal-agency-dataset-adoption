<p>The White House has released an executive order today committing all federal government data to be open and machine-readable.Signed by President Barack Obama – who was also one of the people behind the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Bill of 2006, back in the day when he was a Senator.That Bill became an act – and led directly to the creation of data.gov.Just for reference, an executive order is a decree of the President which has the full force of law.</p>
