<p>Our users trust Google with a lot of very important data, whether it’s emails, photos, documents, posts or videos.We work exceptionally hard to keep that information safe—hiring some of the best security experts in the world, investing millions of dollars in technology and baking security protections such as 2-step verification into our products.Of course, people don’t always use our services for good, and it’s important that law enforcement be able to investigate illegal activity.This may involve requests for personal information.When we receive these requests, we: scrutinize them carefully to ensure they satisfy the law and our policies;  seek to narrow requests that are overly broad;  notify users when appropriate so they can contact the entity requesting the information or consult a lawyer;  and require that government agencies use a search warrant if they’re seeking search query information or private content, like Gmail and documents, stored in a Google Account.</p>
