<p>The UN has an amazing repository of data hosted at data.un.org and back in 2009 we set up quickly built system to turn the zip-file archives of data into a simple REST API hosted on Google App Engine (the Unofficial UNData API).Over time unfortunately the API code degraded and we weren’t able to support it through 2012 – however we continued to get requests for access.So now, thanks to Kristine on our team , the API is coming back and you can check out the new limited beta here: The new API now has the whole of the World Health Organization data set uploaded and we’re open to suggestions as to what goes up next and how to tweak the API – We aim to add them all over time.</p>
