<p>The Aspen Institute Communications and Society program series on open government will appear on the Aspen Institute blog over six weeks. This is the third post in a six-part series on open government. By sharing the conversations at the 2013 Forum on Communications and Society (FOCAS) and the ideas they inspired, we hope to advance a constructive dialogue around open government and a future of more equitable and accountable governance.The central irony of open government is that it’s often not “open” at all.For all the talk of technology’s broad and inclusive reach, conversations on open government are dominated by those with the means to participate.</p>
