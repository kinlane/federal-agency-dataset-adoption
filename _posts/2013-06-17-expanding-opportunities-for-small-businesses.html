<p>While I’ve only been at GSA a short time, I have been an acquisition professional for almost my entire life.Ensuring that the government fully leverages the creativity and innovation of America’s small businesses has always been an important part of my job.Given that GSA is uniquely positioned to help small businesses find the opportunities in the marketplace, Acting Administrator Dan Tangherlini is committed to doing whatever we can to help them succeed.We’ve already made significant accomplishments.Just consider these numbers: In FY12, more than $2 billion went to companies on our small business governmentwide contracts (GWACs) such as Alliant SB, 8(a)STARS I and II, and VETS.</p>
