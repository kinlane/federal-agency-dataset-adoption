<p>
     While I was <a href="/2012/10/24/my-presentation-to-the-presidential-innovation-fellows/">out in Washington DC this week</a>, one of the Presidential Innovation Fellows in my workshop was from the Department of Energy, and shared one of the best examples of APIs delivering value I’ve seen in awhile.
</p>
<p>
     The <a href="https://bioenergykdf.net/">US Department of Energy has developed the Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework</a> (KDF), which is a platform for researchers and engineers from national laboratories, academia, and private industries to upload files, customize information online, and exchange knowledge with each other.
</p>
<p>
     The Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework provides acess to a landmark “Billion-Ton” bioenergy study on fuel resources, providing a wealth of information from a variety of researchers. The study generated a large volume of interest, and resulted in numerous requests for raw data disclosure from the researchers.
</p>
<p>
     In response the project deployed a web API, providing direct access to raw data, saving the resources necessary to reach out to researchers as well as the researchers valuable time in processing requests and providing data.
</p>
<p>
     The US Department of Energy estimates they <span class="c2">saved $882,000</span> in operational costs and researchers valuable time by bundling the API with the bioenergy study.
</p>
<p>
     This is why I evangelize APIs. The US Department of Energy case study demonstrates not just the value of APIs, but how they can actually make government more efficient and save tax payers money.
</p>
<p>
     In addition I strongly advocate that <a title="APIs and raw data access should be default" href="http://kinlane.com/2012/05/15/diving-deeper-into-data-from-research/">APIs and raw data access should be default</a> for all studies and resulting reports, allowing anyone to dive deeper into the research and provide additional insights.
