<p>The second in our series of guest posts by OKCon 2013 speakers is by Oluseun Onigbinde, Co-Founder/Lead Director BudgIT.He will be speaking at the Technology, Tools and Business session on Tuesday 17th September at 14:15, Room 13, Floor 2.A key consideration in driving open data across the entire literacy chain is how to maximize the attention of users that are mostly interested in other social activities?How does BudgIT, my startup, derive useful actions from our easily sidetracked users?I have formulated five lessons, that form the core of the BudgIT strategy and I hope it will be valuable for friends working in transparency and accountability.</p>
