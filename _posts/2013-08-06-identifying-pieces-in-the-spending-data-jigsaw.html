<p>Despite there being increasing amounts of spending data being published by public bodies around the world, there still seems to be considerable confusion about how to work with it in support of transparency aims.Services such as OpenSpending and Armchair Auditor provide a variety of tools for searching datasets and visualising spend within different service areas, but if we’re more interested in a taking a bottom-up view of the data by looking at individual spending transaction records, where should we start?As we lean forward from our armchairs as volunteer auditors, what other pieces in the spending information jigsaw might we start to look for, and how might we be able to piece them together?Here are a few ideas about some of the things we might look out for, along with some salutary warnings about misreading the data alongside them… An early review of the Armchair Auditor from June 2010 – Armchair Auditor – Local Council Payments – describes how you can identify payments made to particular companies within a spending area, as well as using a simple search string to identify payments that may be made to separate companies within a particular corporate group.A search over one dataset for “capita” identifies “Capita Business Services Ltd”, “Capita Education Resourcing” and “Capita Education Services Ltd”, among others, which we might imagine are related.</p>
