<p>Two and a half years ago, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) launched an interactive online map that shows what high-speed Internet services are available to every neighborhood in the country.This week, we are updating the dataset underlying the National Broadband Map (NBM) for the sixth time since it was established in early 2011 in collaboration with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and partners in every state and territory.The new data – current as of Dec.31, 2012 – reveals what types of technology and speeds are available from more than 2,000 telecommunications companies nationwide.And it confirms that we are making steady progress as a nation in ensuring that all Americans have access to at least a basic level of broadband.</p>
