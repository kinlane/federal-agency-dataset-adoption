<p>Since we launched We the People, our team of developers has been hard at work on the code that makes the whole thing tick.Good thing, too!More than 2 million users joined We the People in the last two months of 2012 alone and some 6 million of you have logged in to the system and left more than 10 million signatures.Thats a lot of citizen engagement for one application to handle, but its done well, and we continue to release updates to the source code onÂ GitHub and Drupal.org Today, though, were starting the next stage of We the Peoples development.</p>
