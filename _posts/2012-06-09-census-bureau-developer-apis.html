<p>To improve access to data and encourage innovation, the Census Bureau has begun to provide API access to some data sets, beginning with the 2010 Census Summary File 1 and the 2010 American Community Survey (five year data).We invite developers to use these beta APIs, join our Developer Forum, and provide feedback to help us move forward with continued API development.Please read the Terms of Service for using the API.Accessing Data Data is accessible to software developers through a stateless HTTP GET request.In order to access data, you will need to insert a key into the request URL in order for query results to be returned.</p>
