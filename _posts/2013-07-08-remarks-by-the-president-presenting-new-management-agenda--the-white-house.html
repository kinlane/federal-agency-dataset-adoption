<p>Back in 2007, when I was first running for this office, I had the opportunity to visit Google headquarters in Mountain View, in Silicon Valley, to discuss ways we could use technology to allow more citizens to participate in their democracy, and bring a government built largely in the 20th century into the 21st century.After all, we had already set out to build a new type of campaign -- one that used technology to bring people together, and then trusted them with that technology to organize on their own.  And the idea was simple:  Instead of bringing more people to the campaign, we wanted to bring the campaign to more people, and let them determine its course and its nature.  If you wanted to make phone calls or knock on doors, you didn’t have to come into a field office first, you could just get the information you needed right on your phone and go out there and do it.  If you wanted to get your friends involved, then we had the tools to help you connect.</p>
