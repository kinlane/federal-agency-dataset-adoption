<p>Its been more than a year since voters went to the polls, after months of constant, targeted and often negative TV ads and mailers in what would be the most expensive election ever.There are still unanswered questions, though, about how a significant portion of that barrage was paid for, with some of the answers just starting to trickle in.  Politically active nonprofits reported spending a record $336 million in 2012 -- not including many millions more they spent in the form of issue ads that werent required to be reported to the Federal Election Commission.Dark money groups -- 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) groups that dont, and arent required to, disclose their donors to the public -- accounted for the vast majority of the spending.  Though their donors will likely never be made public, these groups do file critical financial information with the IRS that gives the public a sense of how the groups financed and coordinated their political activities in 2012 -- long after the fact.</p>
