<p>This book is the culmination of several years of thinking about the principles behind the open government data movement in the United States.In the pages within, I frame the movement as the application of Big Data to civics.Topics include principles, uses for transparency and civic engagement, a brief legal history, data quality, civic hacking, and paradoxes in transparency.</p>
