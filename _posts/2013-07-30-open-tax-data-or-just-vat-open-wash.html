<p>This post is by Chris Taggart, the co-founder and CEO of OpenCorporates, the largest open database of companies in the world, and a member of the Open Government working group.[Disclosure: I am on the UK Tax Transparency Board, which has not yet discussed these proposals, but will be doing so at the next meeting in early September] A little over a week ago, Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) published a consultation on publishing its data more widely, and in it stated its intention to join the open-data movement.The UK helped secure the G8’s Open Data Charter, which presumes that the data held by Governments will be publicly available unless there is good reason to withhold it.It is important that HMRC plays a full part.HMRC’s relationship with businesses and individuals is unique, and this is reflected in the scope and depth of the information HMRC collects, creates and protects on behalf of taxpayers.</p>
