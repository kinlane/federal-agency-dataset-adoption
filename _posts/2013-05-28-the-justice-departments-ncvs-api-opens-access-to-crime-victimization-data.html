<p>The Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has released an API for access to National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data: NCVS API.NCVS data includes the frequency, characteristics and consequences of criminal victimization in the United States compiled on an annual basis.The API constitutes one of many steps the federal government plans to make in an attempt to open access to data.When announcing the Federal Digital Strategy, President Obama exclaimed: The NCVS API helps answer the President’s inquiry, because the NCVS datasets are simply to large to manually digest.Almost 80,000 households and more than 143,000 individuals are interviewed each year to build the NCVS database.</p>
