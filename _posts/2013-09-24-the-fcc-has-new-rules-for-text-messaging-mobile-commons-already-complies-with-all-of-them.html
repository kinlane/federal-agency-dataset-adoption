<p>Starting October 16, the FCC will require that marketers obtain written consent from consumers before they can send text messages or launch robocalls.Mobile Commons is already in full compliance with all the FCC’s regulations.The new FCC rules protect consumers from unwanted messaging – a goal that Mobile Commons has always embraced.Previously, marketers only needed to have an existing business relationship, which was established by any inquiry, application, purchase, or transaction.At Mobile Commons, we’re committed to the idea that the best way for consumers and companies to foster long-term relationships is to do so on a foundation of respect and candor.</p>
