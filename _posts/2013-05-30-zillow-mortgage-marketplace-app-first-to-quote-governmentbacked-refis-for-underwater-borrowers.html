<p>While housing reports continue to flood the news with stories of a brisk recovery, more than one-quarter of homeowners with mortgages are still in negative equity.Government-backed programs, namely the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) and FHA Streamline Refinance , help underwater homeowners — those who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth — take advantage of today’s low interest rates.But many have found it both time consuming and challenging to find a lender who is quoting these programs or find a lender with affordable fees associated with these refinance quotes.That’s why today, we’re excited to announce that Zillow’s popular Zillow Mortgage Marketplace app for iPhone and iPad will now enable underwater homeowners to instantly connect with lenders who are quoting HARP and FHA Streamline Refinance loans.The Zillow Mortgage Marketplace app is the first and only mobile app to provide underwater homeowners with easy access to a marketplace of loan quotes for these underwater refinancing programs.</p>
