<p>The Census Bureau plans to launch an application programming interface in the next month that will stream its data straight to developers, Stephen Buckner, director of the bureau’s Center for New Media and Promotion, said Monday.Developers will be able to use data from the APIs to build apps that help homebuyers find neighborhoods with similarly aged children or help restaurants, movie theaters and bowling alleys find the prime locations for their target audiences, he said.The API, which officials are testing now, will include 2010 census information, plus data from the bureau’s American Community Survey, he said.Buckner was speaking at a panel discussion on mobile technology at the Management of Change conference sponsored by American Council for Technology-Industry Advisory Council, a government technology industry group.The Census Bureau also is working on a handful of mobile apps, he said.</p>
