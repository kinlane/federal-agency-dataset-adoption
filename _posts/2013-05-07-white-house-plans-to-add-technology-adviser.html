<p>CNET and AllThingsD reported on Tuesday that President Obama has picked Nicole Wong, a legal director at Twitter, to be the White House’s first chief privacy officer.People familiar with the situation said that the White House does not intend to create a chief privacy officer post, but is looking to add a senior adviser to its chief technology officer, Todd Park.These people described the hiring discussions as developing and said that Ms.Wong was among the leading contenders, who also include other Silicon Valley executives.Social media companies and e-mail providers increasingly find themselves on the front lines of high-level policy discussions concerning privacy.</p>
