<p>Today marks one year since we released the Digital Government Strategy (PDF/ HTML5), as part of the President’s directive to build a 21st Century Government that delivers better services to the American people.The Strategy is built on the proposition that all Americans should be able to access information from their Government anywhere, anytime, and on any device; that open government data - data that are publicly accessible in easy-to-use formats - can fuel innovation and economic growth; and that technology can make government more transparent, more efficient, and more effective.A year later, there’s a lot to be proud of: Information Centric In twelve months, the Federal Government has significantly shifted how it thinks about digital information - treating data as a valuable national asset that should be open and available to the public, to entrepreneurs, and others, instead of keeping it trapped in government systems.  We jump-started this process by releasing hundreds of government datasets via machine-readable formats known as application programming interfaces (APIs).These APIs - which encompass datasets as varied as home and business energy trends  to real-time earthquake notifications around the world - can be used by private-sector developers to create new applications and services.</p>
