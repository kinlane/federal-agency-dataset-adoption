<p>The government of Kenya recently hosted the first ever OGP regional forum in Africa.The event aimed to establish guidelines for OGP activities for African countries; track and take stock of progress on the agenda to date and to think about how to Africanise the global OGP movement further.It attracted a range of delegates from across the continent involved and interested in the pursuit of open governance â€“ government representatives, civil society actors, academia, the media, private sector, and multilateral institutions (see link for details).Open governance is built on the principle of the universal right to access to information on the conduct of government and it places its value in enhancing effective public oversight.It aims to open up government affairs, (previously kept secret) to make it easier to scrutinise public officers and hold them to account.</p>
