<p>Last summer, we launched our first application programming interface (also known as an API), and this week we have made it even more useful.Now three decades worth of statistics about America’s people, their characteristics, and the communities where they live are available in the API, making it easier for developers to create Web and mobile apps fueled with Census Bureau statistics.In addition to 2010 Census data and American Community Survey five-year estimates, the API now contains census data from 1990 and 2000.  Providing API access to more of our statistical and publicly available data sets is just one way we are changing how we do business in line with the Digital Government Strategy and open data initiatives.If you wonder what an API can do, you can find an example right on Census.</p>
