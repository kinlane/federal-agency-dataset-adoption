<p>The east and west coasts of the United States are known for their differences.The perception is that east coast people value being dressed-up, straightforward, and more traditional while west coast residents celebrate originality, flexibility, and flip-flops.I recently discovered more coastal differences in a place I didn’t expect – the open government movement.I believe the attitudes in each region result in a different approach to achieving open government.Is one better than the other?</p>
