<p>The Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR), one of the oldest nonprofit investigative reporting organizations in the United States, has just announced the launch of the brand new VA Backlog API which allows anyone to access the VA backlog-related data available in the CIR database.Back in August 2012, the CIR published an interactive map (updated weekly) that demonstrates and compares in real-time the backlogs and wait times at 58 VA regional offices.Since the publication of the VA backlog interactive map, many well known journalists and media outlets have been citing CIRâ€™s data analysis in stories that bring attention to the VA backlog.CIR data analysis has been used in reporting of the VA backlog by The Daily Show, The New York Times, PBS NewsHour, Fox News, MSNBC Melissa Harris-Perry, NPR, CNN and many more.Image Credit: CIR The new VA Backlog API is available to the public and can be used to create VA backlog data-driven applications for websites and mobile devices as well as to create interactive visualizations such as maps, charts and graphs.</p>
