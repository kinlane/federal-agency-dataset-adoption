<p>The Open Economics Working Group would like to introduce the Open Economics Principles, a Statement on Openness of Economic Data and Code.A year and a half ago the Open Economics project began with a mission of becoming central point of reference and support for those interested in open economic data.In the process of identifying examples and ongoing barriers for opening up data and code for the economics profession, we saw the need to present a statement on the guiding principles of transparency and accountability in economics that would enable replication and scholarly debate as well as access to knowledge as a public good.We wrote the Statement on the Open Economics Principles during our First and Second Open Economics International Workshops, receiving feedback from our Advisory Panel and community with the aim to emphasise the importance of having open access to data and code by default and address some of the issues around the roles of researchers, journal editors, funders and information professionals.Second Open Economics International Workshop, June 11-12, 2013 Read the statement below and follow this link to endorse the Principles.</p>
