     I spend a lot of time on API Evangelist getting excited about APIs. Going on three years doing this, I'm getting a little more hardened in my view on what is "good" in the API space. Along with that evolution, I'm getting my priorities in order.

     While I may get excited about cloud computing APIs or quantified self APIs, there are other areas I think are straight up priorities--ones that we can't ignore. To support this I'm launching several research projects into areas I have labeled as API priorities:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Federal Government" href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Federal Government</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="City Government APIs" href="http://city-government.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">City Government</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Education APIs" href="http://education.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Education</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Library APIs" href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Healthcare</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Library APIs" href="http://libraries.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">Libraries</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="University APis" href="http://university.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">Universities</a>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     These represent areas I'm actively doing research in, looking for the best APIs, tools, services, building blocks and news while also generating as much analysis and white papers as I can to help define what is going on.
</p>
<p>
     As with all of the API Evangelist network of research projects, everything is a work in progress and represents what I have time to dive into. If you see anything missing, or feel some priority areas are not represented, let me know.
