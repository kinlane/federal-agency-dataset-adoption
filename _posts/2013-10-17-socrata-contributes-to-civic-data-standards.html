<p>Socrata is excited to help cities develop and implement open data standards that improve government efficiency and accelerate business growth.With Socrata’s platform, cities can immediately join the growing ecosystem of open data standards such as HouseFacts, LIVES, and Open 311 — standards supported by the national nonprofit, Code for America.People benefit from technical standards every day.They are what allow drivers to buy gas from any station without fear of using incompatible fuels and standards are what allow a text message from a Verizon phone to be transmitted to an AT&amp;T phone.Civic data standards operate in a similar manner, but their use within modern applications is relatively new.</p>
