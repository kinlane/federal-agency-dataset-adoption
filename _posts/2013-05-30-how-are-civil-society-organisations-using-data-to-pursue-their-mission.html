<p>I am pleased to be joining the School of Data, where I will be focusing on how civil society organisations (CSOs) and advocacy groups are using data to pursue their mission, in the service of the public good – from greater election transparency, to alerting people in conflict zones to attacks, and reporting and advocacy around energy and climate change.Over the coming weeks, we are going to be collecting the best examples of how CSOs are using data to improve their research, to boost their advocacy and outreach, or simply to inform and assist their work, by using analysis, visualisations and other means.If you know of any particularly compelling examples, then we’d love to hear from you.You can contact me via email (liliana.bounegru[at]okfn.</p>
